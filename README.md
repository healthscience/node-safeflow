# node-safeflow
Node.js wrapper for safeFLOW

For a start this will be the Node Reference Implementation of safeFLOW.

What is safeFLOW?  It is an entity component system (ECS), usually found in computer game development and more recently by Mozill as a <a hreaf="https://blog.mozvr.com/introducing-ecsy/">data oriented webflow</a>, a novel Knowledge Bundle Ledger (KBL) and rules to enable decentralised machine learning (DML). Library reference contracts are the only inputs allowed and are prepared by the Network Library tools and composer contracts, see <a href="https://github.com/DaMaHub/networklibrary">Network Library</a>

The goals is to write modules in rust so safeFLOW can run from sensors to pcs to mobile computers. 
See RUST implemenation https://github.com/healthscience/safeflow

Where we are at:
=================
This is a hybrid implementation of an ECS.  Bringing together a data science process flow with data oriented design.

Data: The first implementation is using data from <a href="http://gadgetbridge.org/">GadgetBridge</a>open data wearable project and air quality data from <a href="https://sensor.community/en/">Luftendaten</a>


Installation
==============

npm install



Implemenation
==============

Node-safeFlow is implemented a default module in the <a href="https://github.com/DaMaHub/peerlink">PeerLink</a> 'peer to peer middleware" software.


Ideas, diagrams and documentation
==================================

coming soon
